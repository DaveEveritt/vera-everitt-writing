Spiritual Thinking

My mother, Vera, maintained a close friendship with the author, Jungian therapist and Leicester-based pioneer of student counselling services [Mary Swainson](https://leicester.omeka.net/exhibits/show/so-that-they-may-have-life/mary-swainson-1/mary-swainson), helping prepare her texts for publication. She read a wide range of books on what was then termed “The Ancient Wisdom” including post-[Theosophical](https://www.britannica.com/topic/theosophy) writers—particularly [Alice A. Bailey](https://www.lucistrust.org/books/about_alice_a_bailey) and [Vera Stanley Alder](https://albion.org.uk/vera-stanley-alder-1894-1984/). Before the current New Age, these interests were very influential among a forward-thinking circle of people who aimed to better the world and find independent spiritual paths away from organised religion.

Vera also participated in an originally North Indian Hindu/Sikh religious movement that drew on the [Sant Mat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Sant_Mat_movements) tradition. Founded in 1960, it peaked worldwide in the early 70s and had a presence in Leicester. called [Divine Light Mission](https://newreligiousmovements.org/d/divine-light-mission/) (DLM) its primary message was “in principle all religions are one“ and the path to peace cpomes from sitting quietly and looking within (using specific meditation techniques). By then it had become focussed on the [founder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Maharaj)’s son [Prem Rawat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat), who spoke at Glastonbury Fayre in 1971, attracting people seeking hope after the collapse of 60s counterculture. The movement decayed in the mid-70s. Vera used DLM as a way of learning and exploring meditation, and as a sympathetic setting and fellowship within which she felt able to explore her own spirituality and share her path with others. Some of her writing is in the form of notes taken at related events. However, DLM was only a temporary part of her much wider range of influences.

The writing here is in the form of short notes and pieces, written spontaneously in a lined exercise book.
