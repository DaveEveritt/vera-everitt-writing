# The Rays

(NOTE: “the Rays”—typically seven in number—are taken from the Theosophically-inspired literature Vera used to read)

The Rays are strands of radiation issuing from the innermost Source the Ultimate. They are stepped down in force, in brilliance or more technically in frequency, from the Hub of the wheel, which is the First Cause, the Point of their inception. out towards the perimeter, the rim of the wheel that contains all the universes—both of spirit and of matter.

These rays on that outward journey from the Mind of the Most High, lose power and perfection, and on the perimeter, they weave into the physical things we know, stars, Sun and Earth.

Thus do the Divine Rays create and sustain as a continuous act, all the worlds. They are as the Spokes of the Wheel of Creation, the Hub is the very Mind of the Most High. It is this factor which gives life and mind and the eternal Core of Spirit to all living things. Conversely, as the Rays recede into the depths of the many-dimensional wheel, they carry within them and weave the structure of the realms above, the Universes of Spirit. The journey from the perimeter towards the Central Sphere of the Divine is the purpose and goal of all life.

The ultimate, the Source of all Light, is the mind of the Most High. The radiant properties of \[this] Mind stream outwards from the Central Source and fill the Universe, they weave all that is. Therefore the properties of the Mind of the Most High are existent in all things—in accordance with their degree. The Central Source is Light Supernal, all perfection, all holiness, all Mind, all Being, all beatitude, all Bliss, THAT the I inexpressible is above all qualities that we can name. The Radiations from THAT bring with them the qualitative powers of Creation.
