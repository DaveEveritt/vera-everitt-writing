# A Day in The Life of a Wren (Circa 1943, age 19-20)

Awakened from deep sleep at 0700, by Wren from cabin going on duty, who yells in ear “Hey, it's 7 o'clock”, grunt, and turn over – half-an-hour later, suddenly woken with ‘getting-up!’ sounds outside — splashing, running, shouting, then silence - suddenly realise lateness of hour, spring (or rather crawl) out of bed — has been raining during night, so have to paddle about trying to miss pools on floor, call other occupant of cabin, Elsie, and go and wash - turn hot tap on, steaming hot water comes out, put plug in, and turn cold tap on, nothing happens, so stand and wait, still nothing happens, realise have forgotten towel, go back to cabin for it, come out and find cold tap gushing avay, turn off quiíckly but find that it has made water in basin cold - turn hot tap on, peculiar noises issue from tap’s inmards, but no water. Wash in cold water in despair.

Come back after washing to discover Elsie still in bed, tell her it’s eight o’clock (a mere guess on my part, which I hope is wrong) says she can’t get up, but does after thinking it over. Dress and go downstairs, get breakfast, though through being late, takes twice as long, because we have to hunt around looking for bread, ask at various tables if they mind us having some, either get greeted with stony silence, (or weak ‘no’s) take it anyway, have to wait for tea, go to look for our butter jar while waiting, find it at back of cupboard where it wasn’t put the night before, sit down with sigh after having procured it — tea comes, scramble for some, sit down again, discover haven’t any knives or forks, go and wash some, come back, sit down for last time.

Finally, finish breakfast, rush upstairs, clean teeth, make face up, try to get in bathroom - impossible, so decide it's not worth vaiting for. Puy trouser legs in socks for cycling, start putting scarf on head, over hat (strictly against rules) but someone walks along corridor at wrong moment, door happens to be ajar, also at wrong moment, and I get a blast for putting Scarf on head — abashed, go đownstairs, give station card in, and go out to find cycle, after getting mixed up in about a dozen on them, finally find mine right at back — pull, push, kick, heave — joy at last, cycle is out, slightly the worse for wear — put lights on, rear one iimmediately goes out, put it on again, get on cycle, front one goes out — touch it, and it comes on again (I have to keep doing this every time I ride over a lump).

It’s very cold and very foggy — try to ride down drive, but drive is full of ruts, owing to mud, cycles and frost, and after nearly caming off about six times, decide discretion the better part of valour, and walk rest of drive, which makes me later than I already am. Cycle up a long hill, no three speed, so am very hot by the tine I reach top, come to fork in road, say goodbye to Elsie and cycle up next hill, get in about 8.45 — try to look unconcerned when asked about time, petty officer says I'm late, he knows what time I came in because he was behind me — decides he can't do anything about it on those grounds, so make up mind to be early in future.

Go into Store, no-one else has lit fire, so light it nyself with aid of paper and paraffin, finally succeed in exciting spark of life in it, have to watch it carefully, it is inclined to go out suddentỳy without giving notice. Try to keep warm by sweeping concrete floor of store, fetch water from static water tank across the road for laying dust, nearly drown myself in attempt, laughter from men, they đon’t help me, always too busy. Get floor done, make fire up, stand andshiver and wonder what next — get a customer, serve same, talk a while, customer goes, turn round and find fire on verge of retiring — try to coax life back, nearly blow self up pouring paraffin on, frayed edges on jacket and cuffs đisappear, so does hair on hand.

Finally get fire alight again, and find it is stand-easy time; hunt for cups, can't find any, so use a stores item, which đoes very well (can’t disclose what it is for security reasons — wouldn't have any left in stores!) get over stand-easy, which takes some time, serve another custamer, get over that, find it’s lunchtine, so close store, and try to get on van (it’s meant to hold about twenty — gets about two hundred and twenty on) which looks rather like a [black maria](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/bedford-blackmaria--172051648247904484/), only it isn’t black; van starts, am nearly pushed through side of same, by weight of bodies, then van turns and it’s my turn to push, reach destination, very battered, almost suffocated, but still living, rush to dinner — look at it, and make for [NAAFI](https://naafi.co.uk/history/ "Armed Forces Canteen"), stand in queue for coffee and cakes, sigh and buy rock buns, eat them and drink coffee, talk about morning’s work, or previous night out — “oh look, there's Harry, excuse me” go and talk to Harry, then spend rest of lunchtime searching for friends who have mysteriously đisappeared, find them eventually — looking for me, decide to walk back with them, and be independent of van, which passes us, and hoots derisively when doing so — men looking out of back also make rude remarks — we stick noses in air and make no coment — get back and get told “You’re early — for tororrow morning” — stick nose higher, and trip over silly packing case in centre of floor, men laugh, I disappear into store, face very red — rush to fire — no good, it couldn’t wait any longer for me — procure more paraffin, get asked if I intend setting fire to store with all that paraffin, treat remarks with contempt as usual and relight fire, sit doun for a while, and contemplate on fate of WRENS. Decide to work, so start re-stowing some racks, keep at this for what seems centuries, decide have done enough for present, go and fire-watch for a few seconds (or so it seems), Petty Officer comes in full of wrath, saying he always finds me in a state of idleness vhen he comes in, try to explain about all the work I’ve done, P.0. goes out, but I’m sure he doesn’t believe me, anyway it’s stand easy, so sit down again and talk; prolong stand-easy for as long as we dare, then go half-heartedly back to work - work for what seems hours, then find out it’s tea-time. Go and collect bread and butter, and maybe, jam, bring back to store, attempt to
